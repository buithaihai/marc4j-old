 * <p><code>Directory</code> is a helper class to build a directory.  </p>
 * <p>The directory is an index to the location of the variable
 * fields within a record. The directory consists of entries. Each
 * directory entry is 12 characters in length. The structure of each
 * entry according to the MARC standard is as follows:</p>
 * <pre>
 * TAG     LENGTH_OF_FIELD     STARTING_CHARACTER_POSITION
 * 00-02   03-06               07-11
 * </pre>
 * <p>This structure is returned by the {@link #marshal()}
 * method.</p>
 * <p>The starting character position gives the starting position of
 * the variable field to which the entry corresponds relative to
 * the base address of data of the record. A starting character position
 * or length of field of fewer than five digits is right justified and
 * unused positions contain zero's.</p>
