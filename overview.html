    The goal of MARC4J is to provide an easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) for working with <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/">MARC XML</a> in Java. MARC stands for MAchine Readable Cataloguing and is a widely used exchange format for bibliographic data. MARC XML provides a loss-less conversion between MARC (MARC21 but also other formats like UNIMARC) and XML.

    MARC4J provides readers and writers for MARC and MARC XML. A {@link org.marc4j.MarcReader} implementation parses input data and provides an iterator over a collection of {@link org.marc4j.marc.Record} objects. The record object model is also suitable for in-memory editing of MARC records, just as DOM is used for XML editing purposes. Using a {@link org.marc4j.MarcWriter} implementation it is possible to create MARC or MARC XML. Once MARC data has been converted to XML you can further process the result with XSLT, for example to convert MARC to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although MARC4J is primarily designed for Java development you can use the command-line utilities {@link org.marc4j.util.MarcXmlDriver} and {@link org.marc4j.util.XmlMarcDriver} to convert between MARC and MARCXML. It is also possible to pre or post process the result using XSLT, for example to convert directly from MODS to MARC or from MARC to MODS.
