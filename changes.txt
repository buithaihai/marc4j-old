Changes to MARC4J 2.2

MARC4J 2.2 is a minor release providing some bug fixes and some new functionality.

There is a very short time between release 2.1 and 2.2, but during the writing of the 
tutorial I fixed some small errors.
 
Most important is the addition of a samples package. There is now also an extensive
tutorial available on MARc4J. Check the Documentation section at 
http://marc4j.tigris.org.

- Fixed encoding issue in MarcXmlWriter. The default constructor did not use the default UTF-8 encoding.
- Added the Comparable interface to VariableField
- Implemented compareTo in VariableFieldImpl
- Added sorting using the comparable implementation in Record when adding fields so that they appear in the right order
- Added a package org.marc4j.samples containing sample programs
- Added getters and setters for id in the record model to enable persistency models like Hibernate
- Created an extensive tuorial on MARC4J
