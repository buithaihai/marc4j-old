Changes to MARC4J 2.3.1

MARC4J 2.3.1 is a minor release with some encoding fixes

- Fixed encoding bug in MarcStreamReader: now sets ISO8859_1 as default as alternative for MARC-8 and 
  UNIMARC encoding alternative. For MARC 21 the ledare is checked: space is ISO 8859_1 and a is UTF-8.
  When an encoding is provided in the MarcStreamReader constructor, this encoding overrides 
  the default encoding and the leader encoding value.
- MarcXmlDriver: when converting from MARC-8 to UTF-8 character coding scheme in leader (pos. 9) is set to 'a'.
- XmlMarcDriver: when converting from UTF-8 to MARC-8 character coding scheme in leader (pos. 9) is set to space.

Changes to MARC4J 2.3

MARC4J 2.3 is a minor release mainly providing a bug fix in MarcXmlWriter.

- Fixed bug in MarcXmlWriter. Changed second indicator attribute from ind1 to ind2 in SAX qualified name parameter. 
  This bug created two ind1 attributes for a datafield in JDK 1.5 environments.
- Added creation of default leader value to the MarcFactory.newRecord() method
- Moved test classes to org.marc4j.test package
- Added new examples in org.marc4j.samples package
- Removed org.marc4j.samples classes from marc4j.jar

Changes to MARC4J 2.2

MARC4J 2.2 is a minor release providing some bug fixes and some new functionality.

There is a very short time between release 2.1 and 2.2, but during the writing of the 
tutorial I fixed some small errors.
 
Most important is the addition of a samples package. There is now also an extensive
tutorial available on MARc4J. Check the Documentation section at 
http://marc4j.tigris.org.

- Fixed encoding issue in MarcXmlWriter. The default constructor did not use the default UTF-8 encoding.
- Added the Comparable interface to VariableField
- Implemented compareTo in VariableFieldImpl
- Added sorting using the comparable implementation in Record when adding fields so that they appear in the right order
- Added a package org.marc4j.samples containing sample programs
- Added getters and setters for id in the record model to enable persistency models like Hibernate
- Created an extensive tuorial on MARC4J
